### Emoji didn't work yesterday but I made it work today :+1:

#### How I Did It
First, I added [Emoji for Jekyll](https://github.com/yihangho/emoji-for-jekyll). Then I found out it didn't work with GitHub Pages. 

#### Lucky Me
The very nice guy yihangho who created the Emoji for Jekyll respository has the suggestion of using [Jemoji](https://help.github.com/articles/emoji-on-github-pages/) and this [link](https://github.com/jekyll/jemoji).

#### Plus a little magic from myself
It was suggested to add this `emoji: src: "/assets/images/emoji"` to `_config.yml`. But that didn't work for me. I changed it to this `emoji: src: "https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons"`. voil√† :sunglasses:

#### How Do I Feel Now?

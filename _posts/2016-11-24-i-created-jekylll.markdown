A very gloomy looking day, even Sasha refused to get outside. It saved me time to get jekyll off the gound. Now, it is installed and setup locally. Working on my first post before going to bed, I am making it a short one.

I stumbled upon jekyll a couple days ago. Once I learned that jekyll is a website generator for minimal, static blogs that can be hosted on GitHub, I knew it was an answer to my desire to begin blogging/journaling, versioning, and exploring doing new things.

These are the websites that helped me get jekyll installed and my blog hosted on Github:  
* [The Programming Historian]  
* [jekyll-docs]  
* [jekyll-talk]  

These are websites that I will turn to in order to create better looking pages:
* [kramdown]  
* [Typora]

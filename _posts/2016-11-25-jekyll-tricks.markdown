### These I Keep
Getting Error Message: Unknown ruby interpreter version (do not know how to handle): RUBY_VERSION.  
* run `env | grep 'RUBY'`. Here is the [Fix].  
* run Jekyll serve: bundle exec jekyll serve.

### Things I Like
* Use Git on my desktop and GitHub Desktop on my laptop. It is a bit __schizo but so much fun__. Learning so much. It is insane.  
* Start incorporating more Markdown. This [cheatsheet] helps a lot!  
* Better [Git Doc].
* Today is Good Friday. Not buying a single thing makes truly __GOOD__!
